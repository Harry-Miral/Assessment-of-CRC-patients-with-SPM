# Assessment-of-CRC-patients-with-SPM

Run model1.py and model2.py to get the final result. The trained weight files are stored in the Weight folder. Since we used five cross-validations, each fold has a corresponding weight file. In addition, model1.py and model2.py already contain all the models. For details, please refer to the comments in the python file.We use python version 3.9.
